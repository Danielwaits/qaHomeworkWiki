Saw a few deep throws today by Justin Fields in team periods. Tyler Scott beat Tyrique Stevenson but the throw was incomplete on a diving attempt.

Velus also had a step on Stevenson but ball was overthrown in end zone.

Luke Getsy had an insightful explanation on how the Bears are continually working with Justin Fields on how and when and why to use his special gifts as a runner.

Genuine question: do the #Bears have the best RB trio in the NFL?

What they lack in a high-end RB1 they make up for with insane depth. Teams like ATL, PHI and LAC give them a run for their money, but Chicago might genuinely have 3 starting-caliber RBs, IMO.
